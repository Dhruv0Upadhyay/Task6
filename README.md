# Task6
This is Summer Internship Task - 6, in which I used LBPH (Linear Binary Pattern Histogram) and a haar cascade model. 
The main objective of the task is to integrate machine learning with cloud computing and some other concepts to make a powerful use case.
In this task, we have a model for which first the dataset(images) is collected and converted in Gray color for the 2-D array. Later that dataset is used to train the model. Finally, once the model is trained, it has some assigned tasks while predicting. 

So, while predicting if the face matches then an image will be clicked and send via email to the provided email-id followed by a WhatsApp message and lastly using Boto3 library launching EC2 instance and attaching 5 GB volume to it separately.
